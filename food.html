    <h1>FLAVOURS OF INDIA</h1>
    
        <div class="t">
            India’s diverse cuisine offers a rich blend of flavors from every state, reflecting centuries of history, culture, and tradition. From the bold and spicy Chettinad Chicken Curry 🔥 of Tamil Nadu to the creamy Butter Chicken 🧈🍗 of Punjab, every dish tells a story of its region. Whether you love fiery spices, rich gravies, or subtle flavors, Indian food has something to satisfy every craving.

            For street food lovers, India offers an endless variety of quick bites bursting with flavor. Delhi’s Golgappas 🏙️ deliver a tangy and spicy crunch, while Mumbai’s Vada Pav 🌆 is the perfect balance of soft and crispy textures. Kolkata’s Puchkas 🍽️ are a must-try for their unique spice blends, and Indore’s Poha-Jalebi 🍋🍯 offers a delightful mix of sweet and savory. If you’re in Lucknow, don’t miss the famous Tunday Kebabs 🍢, known for their melt-in-the-mouth texture, or Chennai’s Sundal 🌱, a healthy and flavorful chickpea snack often enjoyed at beaches.

            Beyond street food, India’s traditional delicacies highlight the diversity of local ingredients and cooking techniques. The fragrant Hyderabadi Biryani 🍛 is a royal dish infused with saffron, slow-cooked meat, and aromatic rice. Kerala’s Appam with Stew 🥥 pairs soft, lacy rice pancakes with a coconut-infused curry that soothes the palate. Coastal regions boast dishes like Goan Fish Curry 🐟, a spicy and tangy seafood preparation rich in coconut and tamarind. Rajasthan’s Dal Baati Churma 🌾 is a wholesome combination of crispy wheat dumplings, flavorful lentils, and a sweet crumbled dessert. Assam’s Masor Tenga 🍋, a tangy fish curry, is a refreshing and light dish perfect for warm climates.

            No Indian meal is complete without a touch of sweetness. Desserts play a significant role in celebrations, festivals, and everyday indulgence. Bengal’s Rasgulla 🍡 is a soft, spongy delight soaked in sugar syrup, while Gujarat’s Mohanthal 🍯 offers a rich, nutty sweetness. The famous Mysore Pak 😋 from Karnataka, with its buttery texture, simply melts in your mouth. For those who enjoy chilled treats, Rajasthan’s Malpua with Rabri 🥞 is a must-try, featuring deep-fried pancakes soaked in syrup and served with thickened milk. Tamil Nadu’s Payasam 🍶, a creamy and fragrant rice pudding, is an essential part of any festival or celebration.
